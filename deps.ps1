# assigning a native command's output to a variable under that preference turns
# an expected nonzero exit (the --diarize package probes below, which are
# expected to fail on a fresh machine) into a terminating error, even with
# stderr redirected to $null. That aborted the whole install before it could
# report the ffmpeg/faster-whisper-xxl status or finish writing stubs.
